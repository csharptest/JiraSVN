	/// What is this for?
	/// It fixes a flaw in the databinding of the SelectedIndex property when the databinding
	/// is configured to update on property change instead of on validation.  When configured
	/// this way the combo box will get confused about the currently selected item and revert
	/// it's selection to the prior value.  By subscribing to the change of the SelectedIndex
	/// below we can then use the control's "BeginInvoke" to delay execution of the change
	/// until after the completion of the control's state change.  This way the control will
	/// complete setting the newly selected item prior to us being notified of the property
	/// change.
	/// </summary>
